## Trivago Interview Solution

👀  Writing Trivago Interview Solution App using [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), in 100% Kotlin, using Android Jetpack Components. 

### Prerequisites 

Before every commit, make sure you run the following commands:

```shell script
./codeAnalysis
```

To check for dependency updates, run the following command:

```shell script
./gradlew dependencyUpdate
```

Refer to this [issue](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/10248), if you get any issues running the lint commands on the terminal :rocket:

### Background

Implement a small but scalable app which interacts with the open [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/). The app should contain 2 main areas:

- Character Search (Home Screen)
- Character Details

The following attributes should be displayed for the character details:

- name
- birth year
- height (in cm and feet/inches)
- name (species)
- language (species)
- homeworld (species)
- population (planets)
- films (movies the character appeared in)
- opening crawl (detailed description of each movie)

On app start, the user lands on the character search screen. The user can search for characters from the Star Wars universe. The result of the search should display a character list. When tapping on a character, details are displayed as defined above.

## Dependencies

All the dependencies (external libraries) are defined in the single place - Gradle `buildSrc` folder. This approach allows to easily manage dependencies and use the same dependency version across all modules. 

## Some notable issues

This sections mentions some of the issues that I have come across:

- UI Tests fail on an Emulator running API 26 (Android 8), and are successful on an Emulator running API 29 (Android 10)

- dokka documentation task doesn't work when run from the top level Trivago task

- The spotless plugin doesn't apply the license header, and the jacoco plugin doesn't work as expected. Need more research on how to set them up using gradle plugins

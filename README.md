👀  Writing Trivago Interview Solution App using [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), in 100% Kotlin, using Android Jetpack Components. 


### Background

Implement a small but scalable (!) app which interacts with the open Star Wars API at https://swapi.dev/.

The app should contain 2 main areas:
• Character Search (Home Screen)
• Character Details

The following attributes should be displayed for the character details:
• name
• birth year
• height (in cm and feet/inches)
• name (species)
• language (species)
• homeworld (species)
• population (planets)
• films (movies the character appeared in)
• opening crawl (detailed description of each movie)

On app start, the user lands on the character search screen.

The user can search for characters from the Star Wars universe. The result of the search should display a character list.

When tapping on a character, details are displayed as defined above.

## Tech-stack

Min API level is set to [`16`](https://android-arsenal.com/api?level=16), so the presented approach is suitable for over
[98% of devices](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards) running Android. This project takes advantage of many
popular libraries and tools of the Android ecosystem. Most of the libraries are in the stable version.

* Tech-stack
    * [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) + [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - perform background operations
    * [KOIN](https://insert-koin.io/) - dependency injection
    * [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - networking
    * [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
        * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - notify views about database change
        * [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - perform action when lifecycle state changes
        * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way
    * [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) - image loading library with Kotlin idiomatic API
    * [Stetho](http://facebook.github.io/stetho/) - application debugging tool
